Prehistoric Tomb Surveying - a study

This is not a coding git. It is used to record the changes made to the papers of the study.
In it several tomb plans are presented that fit to a grid-of-squares geometry.
Within the grid a Pythagorean triangle is drawn, which is used as inscribed triangle for several tombs.
The geometrical construction is linked to earliest writings about geometry in Babylonia, Egypt, China and Greece.
The structural elements of a tomb that support a geometry are eveluated against archaeological finds
